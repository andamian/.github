# Contributing to OpenCADC

OpenCADC is the GitHub Organization used by the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) and the Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomical Research (CANFAR).

We welcome contributions at OpenCADC!  If you have a fork or clone of any of the software maintained here in the OpenCADC GitHub repository, please consider contributing any changes you make back to the origin repository here at OpenCADC.  This benefits all involved.  We will be sure to respond in a timely manner to any issues or pull requests created.

## Creating Issues

Create issues when you discover any sort of problem with OpenCADC software.  If you end up working on a solution for the issue, it should be referenced in the associated Pull Request.

## Guilelines for Pull Requests

In OpenCADC, the publicly released code lives in the main (or master) branch of the GitHub repository.  Therefore, contributions (modifications, additions) to OpenCADC software must be done through Pull Requests (PR).  While the pull request is open, OpenCADC maintainers will correspond with you through the PR.  Generally, before the PR is merged to the main branch, repositories will require:
* A code review with approval
* Code style conventions to be met
* Automated tests to pass
